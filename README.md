# Agri-Productivity-Analysis-India
# Analyzing Agricultural Productivity Across Indian States

## Introduction

This Power BI project explores agricultural productivity across various Indian states, aiming to uncover patterns in crop production, fertilizer usage, and regional differences in yield. The goal is to help stakeholders better understand how different states contribute to the nation's agricultural output and what factors may affect productivity.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this analysis includes information related to crop production, fertilizer consumption, and state-wise distribution.  

## Key Visualizations

- Crop Production by State
- Fertilizer Usage Comparison
- Year-wise Productivity Trends
- Correlation Between Fertilizer Use and Yield
- Top States by Crop Type

## Key Insights

- Certain states have significantly higher productivity due to optimal fertilizer use.
- There's a visible correlation between fertilizer consumption and crop yield in many regions.
- Southern states tend to have better year-round productivity due to climatic advantages.
- Fertilizer overuse in some areas doesn't correlate with better yield, indicating diminishing returns.
